# üëÅÔ∏è Iris Recognition using CNN and OpenCV

This project is a deep learning-based iris recognition system developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV. It uses the **CASIA-Iris-Thousand** dataset to train and test the model, aiming to identify individuals based on iris patterns.
